   - Verify Gmail account settings allow "less secure apps"

2. **"Demo mode" message**:
   - Configure Gmail credentials in your `.env` file
   - Restart the application after configuration

3. **"Invalid email format"**:
   - Check email addresses for typos
   - Ensure proper email format (user@domain.com)

### Security Notes:
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Use app passwords instead of your main Gmail password
- Regularly rotate your app passwords

## Demo Mode

If Gmail credentials aren't configured, the system runs in demo mode:
- Shows success messages but doesn't actually send emails
- Perfect for testing the interface
- Configure credentials to enable real sending

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Gmail credentials** in your `.env` file
2. **Test with a single recipient** first
3. **Try multiple recipients** for batch sending
4. **Use the preview function** to check your templates
5. **Monitor send status** in the distribution history
